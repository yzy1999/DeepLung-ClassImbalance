# DeepLung-ClassImbalance

Try to use four methods (hard negative sample mining; online hard example mining; Focal loss and Gradient harmonizing mechanism) to tackle the class imbalance problem in lung nodule detection.

Results illustrated that the use of Gradient harmonizing mechanism leads to the greatest-improvement in model performance.
